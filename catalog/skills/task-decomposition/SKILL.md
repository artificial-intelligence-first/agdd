# Task Decomposition (task-decomposition)

## Purpose
Transform a candidate-facing payload into the minimal set of sub-agent delegations required by the orchestration workflow.

## When to Use
- A MAG needs to hand off compensation analysis to `compensation-advisor-sag`.
- The caller expects deterministic task lists without branching logic.

## Procedures
1. Normalize the input payload. When the caller supplies `candidate_profile`, reuse it as-is; otherwise treat the entire payload as the profile.
2. Emit a single delegation object targeting `compensation-advisor-sag`.
3. Allow downstream logic to expand into more complex task graphs (future enhancement).

## Examples
`{"candidate_profile": {...}}` â†’ `[{"sag_id": "compensation-advisor-sag", "input": {"candidate_profile": {...}}}]`
